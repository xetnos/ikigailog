So, today, Saturday I woke up at 2:00 in the morning with the necessity of jumping into Ruby, but of course, I need some extra foundations first; wanting to improve a bit regarding some CS concepts, where did I go? Well, the only platform I’ve found so far which teaches Ruby and also has a very nice learning path: The Odin Project.

Also in the meantime, I’ve found some extra jewels about music, yep, not totally coding related ‘cause that’s how I function:

- [Linkin Park & Deryck Whibley - The Catalyst (Live Hollywood Bowl 2017)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnhEuWXLCnA)
- [Sum 41 - Faint [Linkin Park Cover] ft. Mike Shinoda HD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnhEuWXLCnA)
- [Linkin Park - In The End (Live Hollywood Bowl 2017)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2r-iu8uaCNE)
- [The Catalyst (Live at the 2010 MTV VMAs) HD - Linkin Park](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvDpjW2AcmM)

That time of the year is close again, the time the world lost such a wonderful person and voice, talking about Chester Bennington of course. During these months, personally, I listen to a bit of extra Linkin Park songs.

Just created a local SSH key and added it to my GH account following these two docs:

https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/checking-for-existing-ssh-keys

https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent

Navigating through GIT https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-git-basics

glad that as for my understanding, I’ve been doing things okay, as far as my knowledge goes.

P.S: silly me, forgot to publish this thing.
